# OpenCV External Camera Test
Hi guys. Guess whose macbook ran out of storage, has no xcode dev tools, and can't run OpenCV using the default camera anymore? I'm fully committed to the PC life ig but I don't have a webcam...so I busted out the DSLR LOL. Anyways you can read about how it works in the medium articles I wrote about it. This is just the starter code I have for future projects. Thanks for stopping by!
